            <p>
                If you wish to file an issue, you can do so on the specific package's GitHub repository. Try to be descriptive when filing issues, as it makes it easier for us to debug.
            </p>

            <h2>Submitting Pull Requests</h2>

            <p>
                Pull requests are very welcome, but should be within the scope of the project, and follow the repository's code conventions. Before submitting a pull request, it's always good to file an issue, so we can discuss the details of the PR.

            <h3>The Yahoo CLA</h3>

            <p>
                At Yahoo, we have a single <a href="https://yahoocla.herokuapp.com"><b>Yahoo Open Source Contributor License Agreement</b></a> that we ask contributors to <b>electronically sign</b> before merging in their Pull Requests. Here's the CLA's human-readable summary:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <i>You are saying that you have the right to give us this code, which is either your own code, or code that your company allows you to publish. You want to give us this code. We may decide to use this code. You are not going to sue people who use this code, because, after all, you are giving it to an open source project! And if you include code that you didn't write, you'll tell us about it by including the open source license to such code in your contribution so we'll know about it. You are not promising that this code works well, or that you will support it, and we're OK with that.</i>
